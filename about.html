								<p>My name is Niceta (Nee-se-ta not nice-e-ta) Nduku (Nn-du-ko).<br>
									I have broken down my story into parts just to give a better context of me. 
									There is obviously a lot more than there is on this page. You can navigate through the rest of website to see</p>
								
								<h5>Past</h5>
								<p>When I was 7, I wanted to be a mathematician. It later became math professor because that sounded fancier.
									Long story short, I have always a nerd. I loved math and science (the basic story of every person in a STEM degree).
									I was a child who enjoyed school and learning. Passing was not my main motivation, and this is a trait that has 
									stuck with me. I love to understand and figure out... why?<br>
									After maths professor, it was architect, orthopaedic surgeon (very short lived), mechatronics engineer (the longest),
									chemical engineer(also very brief), civil engineer, back to mechatronics then I finally settled on Electrical and
									Computer Engineer. At some point people stopped asking and to this very day, I have friends who do not know what 
									I am studying. Each of these choices had a motivation behind them. Unlike many African people my age or older, my 
									family had no influence on my choice. Something always inspired me. I do not want to use the most clich√© phrase 
									'I wanted to solve problems' but it was the truth. Besides my deep interest in the subject, I want to use what I 
									have to make an impact. 
									</p>

								<h5>present</h5>
								<p>I decided to run away from home and go south of my home to study engineering at the University of Cape Town. It has
									been a long and painful journey. No one properly warned me of its difficulty- though they tried. However, I have 
									learnt so much and grown in ways that I did not imagine.  </p>
								<h5>future</h5>
